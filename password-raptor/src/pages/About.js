            question: "What is Password Raptor?",
            answer: "Password Raptor is a tool designed to help users generate and evaluate secure passwords using personalized inputs and advanced password analysis techniques."
        },
        {
            question: "How does Password Raptor ensure password security?",
            answer: "Password Raptor uses algorithms and libraries like zxcvbn to evaluate password strength. It encourages the use of diverse characters and ensures randomness in generated passwords."
        },
        {
            question: "Is inclusion of different characters important to create a secure password?",
            answer: "Yes, including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols makes it significantly harder for attackers to guess or brute-force your password."
        },
        {
            question: "Why should I avoid using common words in passwords?",
            answer: "Common words make passwords vulnerable to dictionary attacks. Password Raptor detects and penalizes the use of such words."
        },
        {
            question: "How long should my password be?",
            answer: "A secure password should be at least 12 characters long. Longer passwords are generally more secure."
        },
        {
            question: "What is the advantage of using a personalized password?",
            answer: "Personalized passwords are easier to remember and can still be secure when combined with randomness and diverse character types."
        },
        {
            question: "Does Password Raptor store my passwords?",
            answer: "No, Password Raptor does not store or save your passwords. All password generation and evaluation happen locally in your browser."
        },
        {
            question: "Can I use Password Raptor for professional purposes?",
            answer: "Yes, Password Raptor is suitable for both personal and professional use, especially when strong passwords are critical."
        },
        {
            question: "What makes a password strong?",
            answer: "A strong password is long, random, and includes a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols. It should not include easily guessable patterns or common words."
        },
        {
            question: "Is Password Raptor free to use?",
            answer: "Yes, Password Raptor is completely free to use and does not require any account or registration."
        },
        {
            question: "How are passphrases generated?",
            answer: "Passphrases are created by randomly selecting words from a cleaned dictionary. You can also choose to include symbols, numbers, and case variations for added complexity."
        },
        {
            question: "What does 'crack time estimation' mean?",
            answer: "Crack time estimation shows how long it would take an attacker to brute-force your password, using common hardware and algorithms."
        },
        {
            question: "Are passwords checked against known breaches?",
            answer: "No, Password Raptor does not check against breach databases, but it strongly recommends avoiding reused or common passwords."
